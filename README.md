# odin-landing-page

This is a simple product landing page. This is a project from the odin project where I'll be using HTML and CSS to build the webpage. By the end of this project, I'll have a better understanding of CSS flex layouts and how to write proper HTML code to help make proper use of CSS flex to arrange elements appropriately on the web page.
I do not own the images on the page, I downloaded them on pexels. Credit to the owners:
